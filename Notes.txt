Notes:

Need to create a game from scratch.
0. game parameters
	- number of players
	- type of game (round robin, simultaneous, automatic)
1. customers/market conditions
2. your company
3. its products
4. starting conditions for the game
5. begin


MVP
- add products to field
- remove products from field
- pull data from database
- save history of changes to database
- calculate spend and revenue for each round
- introduce obstacles and conditions for each round
-

Next Iteration
- multiplayers at same time, can only manipulate yours
- watcher to track rounds and declare a winner when round is over
- add all code to git hub for tracking

Feature Ideas
- make the company title a pull down to select different companies
- drag product on to and off of board. Need to directly edit the product name
- make the product development time based. Add it to the side and cannot bring it to market until ready!!. It consumes money when in development. Like the doughnuts
-


Choices to get to MVP
- make the game work for 6 teams/companies


Frameworks/libraries
- React.js
- Angular.js - Google
